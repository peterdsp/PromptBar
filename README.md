## ✨ What's New in Version 1.3.0?

- **🌐 Multiple AI Chats Added** – Now support simultaneous chats with multiple AI models, including Grok, Perplexity, Gemini, DeepSeek, Copilot, AI Studio, Mistral, and ChatGPT. Easily switch between models or run multiple conversations from the menubar!  
- **🚀 Official Apple Notarization** – PromptBar is now **notarized by Apple**, meaning smoother installation without security warnings.  
- **📢 Important Update on App Store Plans** – After more than 2-3 months of discussions with the App Store team, we’re saddened to announce that PromptBar will not be part of the App Store at this time. We apologize for this news and any inconvenience it may cause. The app will continue to work seamlessly, and we remain committed to its development and support.  
- **📛 A Journey of Name Changes** – The app was originally named **MacMistral**, inspired by Mistral AI and its copyright-free name Mistral which means "a strong, cold wind that blows through the Rhône valley and southern France into the Mediterranean, mainly in winter". However, Apple flagged the use of "Mac" as non-compliant. We then renamed it to **Mistralis**, but Apple still did not approve. Finally, we settled on **PromptBar**, which Apple initially approved, and we were ready for release. After a 20+ day period of silence, we received a call from their offices in Ireland assuring us the app would be released. Days later, we were met with a lengthy App Store Connect review citing reasons we believe do not hold up, ultimately rejecting the app. It’s frustrating to see that a browser allowing casual access to similar functionalities is acceptable, yet our app—despite paying for the license—faces such strict scrutiny from the Mac App Store, an authority that seems to limit freedom for developers.  
- **📦 Distribution Moving Forward** – You can keep purchasing PromptBar via Ko-fi to support our work, and we deeply appreciate your continued support. Alternatively, you’re welcome to fork the project from our repository [here](https://github.com/peterdsp/MacMistral) and build the app on your own. For now, distribution will be handled through Ko-fi, but we’re in discussions with other marketplaces for future options.  
- **⚡ Performance Enhancements** – Optimized AI model switching and UI responsiveness.  
- **🔧 Minor Bug Fixes** – Addressed small issues to improve user experience.
